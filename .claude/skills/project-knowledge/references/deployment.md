# Deployment and Operations

This public repository has no centrally operated production environment and no
project-owned deployment target. Each operator installs and runs their own bot
on a host they control; the bot and the selected Claude Code or Codex CLI run
as the same operator account on that host.

Repository CI validates changes but does not deploy or publish an operator's
installation. For a persistent Linux installation, the documented runtime is a
systemd service; foreground execution remains suitable for development. The
`bot-setup` skill owns installation, environment setup, systemd configuration,
and troubleshooting. This repository does not define a central update workflow;
each operator owns and documents the repeatable update path for their installation.

Direct access to an operator-owned host is expected for initial bootstrap,
inspection, troubleshooting, approved bounded one-off operations, and emergency
recovery. Direct commands are therefore part of the operator-owned model, while
the chosen repeatable update path should remain documented in the operator's
private deployment knowledge.

Operational evidence is local to each installation: systemd status and journald
logs for service health, plus `/mcpstatus` for the configured agent runtime.
This repository defines no central monitor or alert destination. An operator
who needs outside-in monitoring should run it from a stable control host and
document the check location and notification route in their private deployment
knowledge; tokens and recipient IDs must not be committed here.
